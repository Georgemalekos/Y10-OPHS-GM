#This is a comment
#Variables Vs Constants
#Variables are declared in tital case
#CONSTANTS are declared in CAPITALS

#Examples of variables

Team1Name = "Malekos' mistros"
Team2Name = "Croydon kebabs"

#Variables have a useful name
#Variables store a value (can change)
#Variables can NOT start with a number 
#e.g. 1TeamName = "Croydon kebabs"
#This will cause a syntax error

#Variables can not have a space in the name
#e.g. Team Name = "Croydon kebabs"
# This will be a syntax error

#This is an exaqmple of a CONSTANT
FREETHROW = 1 
TWOPOINTER = 2
THREEPOINTER = 3

#The values in a CONSTANT do NOT change
